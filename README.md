# Lab Experiment 6 – Combined UX Design Scenarios

## AIM  
To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design through a known UX problem, improving the understanding of user-centered design processes.

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT  
Booking an appointment in hospital apps is often confusing or inefficient, leading to user frustration, missed appointments, and poor healthcare experience.

---
  
## DESIGN STEPS  

### 1. Solution Ideation  
- Conducted Crazy 8s and Brainwriting exercises to generate multiple low-fidelity ideas addressing appointment booking challenges.  
- Explored diverse approaches like simplified calendar views, smart reminders, chatbots, and quick rebooking options.

### 2. Creating User Stories  
Based on personas and goals, wrote user stories to capture requirements clearly:

- As a patient, I want to quickly find available appointment slots, so that I can schedule visits without waiting.  
- As a busy professional, I want to receive reminders via SMS and app notifications, so that I don’t forget my appointment.  
- As an elderly user, I want large fonts and simple navigation, so that I can easily book without confusion.  
- As a new patient, I want clear instructions on required documents for appointments, so that I can prepare ahead.  
- As a caregiver, I want to book appointments on behalf of the patient, so that I can assist effectively.

### 3. Creating Scenarios  
Selected user story: "As a busy professional, I want to receive reminders via SMS and app notifications, so that I don’t forget my appointment."

**Scenario Narrative:**  
John is a 35-year-old marketing manager with a hectic schedule. He uses the hospital app to book a specialist appointment. Feeling stressed about his workload, John appreciates the app sending him a reminder two days before his appointment via SMS and a notification on his phone. This helps him adjust his calendar and avoid missing the visit. The app’s simple design makes it easy to confirm or reschedule appointments on the go.

### 5. Information Architecture (IA)  
- Conducted closed card sorting with 10 participants using common hospital app features (e.g., Appointments, Prescriptions, Billing, Profile, Notifications).  
- Created a sitemap organizing the app into main categories: Home, Appointments, Medical Records, Billing, Support.  
- Designed navigation hierarchy ensuring quick access to frequently used features like booking and reminders.

## RESULT  
- Multiple ideas generated from ideation provided innovative ways to ease appointment booking.  
- User stories clarified diverse user needs and improved feature prioritization.  
- Scenario narratives highlighted emotional contexts, enhancing empathy.  
- User flow diagrams mapped a clear, logical booking process.  
- IA design optimized information grouping and navigation paths.

---

## CONCLUSION  
This combined UX exercise reinforces the importance of iterative ideation, user-centered storytelling, clear task flows, and structured information architecture for designing effective and accessible hospital appointment booking apps.
